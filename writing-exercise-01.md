# Writing Excericse 001 - Describe a Ruined Tower

Try writing a short paragraph about a ruined watchtower in Tolkien’s voice. Example:

The old tower stood upon the hill like a sentinel who had forgotten his watch. Ivy wound about its stones, and the wind
played in the hollow of its gate. Once, men had kept fire there, guarding the northern road; but the years had worn even
the memory of their names. Only the crows remained, black-winged heralds of silence.

**My attempt:**
Beautiful seed of an image there, Mart — it already feels like Tolkien in spirit. Let’s shape it into something that captures his cadence, weight, and mythic air, while keeping your original vision intact.

### Your Original

He came out of the woods and stood by a fast-flowing river, and on the bank stood a tall tower. Once standing proud with
guard pacing the battlements, but now only the climbing ivy and the crows that nested in the holes in the walls stood as
sentries. Shouting through a doorway, he was met only by echoes that seemed like the ghosts of a time of grandeur,
splendour and strength.

### Tolkien-Style Rewrite

Out of the shadow of the wood he came, and before him ran a river swift and clear, murmuring of distant snows. Upon its
far bank rose a tall tower, grey with age, yet still proud in its loneliness. Once, the tread of watchful men had echoed
on its battlements, and bright helms had glimmered there beneath the sun; but now only ivy climbed in patient silence,
and black crows kept their solemn watch among the broken stones. He called aloud into the darkened doorway, and the
voice that answered was but his own, wandering among the hollow halls like the memory of lost kings.

### Why It Works (Breakdown)
**Technique**	                  **What Changed**	                                 **Why It Feels Tolkien-esque**
Elevated diction	    Out of the shadow of the wood vs came out of the woods	Slightly archaic syntax gives rhythm and grandeur
Imagery with purpose	    River swift and clear, murmuring of distant snows	        Adds mythic tone  rivers remember things
Sense of time	            Yet still proud in its loneliness	                        Tolkien imbues objects with memory and emotion
Parallelism & rhythm	    Once, the tread of watchful men but now only ivy climbed	Balanced phrasing evokes song-like cadence
Personification & echo	    The voice that answered was but his own	                Suggests the haunting presence of the past
Lexical choice	            Glinting helms, broken stones, lost kings	                Rooted in imagery of fading glory  a Tolkien signature


### Optional: Add a Line of Lore

To deepen the mythic texture, you might slip in a whisper of history:

Men still name it Baranthir’s Tower, though none now remember who Baranthir was.

This one line makes the world feel older than the story itself — one of Tolkien’s finest tricks.

?? Quick Summary

Use archaic syntax sparingly (“Out of the shadow he came”).

Give landscapes memory — they should remember ages long past.

Balance grandeur with quiet decay.

Keep rhythm and sound as vital as meaning.
