# How to write in the style of J R R Tolkien

### 1. Capture the Spirit, Not Just the Style

Tolkien didn’t write fantasy he wrote myth. Every word served the sense that this was a secondary world with its own
history, languages, and destiny.

What to aim for:

Write as though your story has already happened — you’re chronicling ancient events.

Let your narrator carry quiet reverence for lost ages and noble deeds.

Build a sense of deep time; even a single forest has thousands of years behind it.

*The world was grey, the mountains old, The forge’s fire was ashen-cold (Tolkien, Song of Durin)*


### 2. Language & Diction: Elevated but Natural

Tolkien’s prose blends the archaic with the earthy — grand, yet never pompous.

Patterns to imitate:

Use inversion occasionally: “Dark was the path that led them hence.”

Replace abstract with concrete: “A chill wind crept from the North” instead of “It was cold.”

Vary sentence rhythm — long, lyrical lines followed by short, striking beats.

Avoid modern slang and contractions unless in dialogue.

Exercise: Write a simple sentence, then elevate it in Tolkien’s tone.

Plain: The trees were tall and old.  Tolkien-esque: The trees stood tall as towers, their roots deep in forgotten earth,
their leaves whispering the speech of elder days.


### 3. World-Building as Myth-Making

Tolkien’s worlds breathe because language births culture, and culture births story.

Approach:

Create names from consistent linguistic roots even invent your own tongues.

Anchor myths, songs, and prophecies into your world’s timeline.

Write as if you’re translating ancient texts rather than inventing them.

Think of your narrator as a learned scribe preserving fragments of an older world.


### 4. Themes: Light Against Shadow

Tolkien’s moral universe is clear but never naïve. His heroes struggle with temptation, despair, pride, and faith — but
always with hope.

Core motifs:

The Fall: everything great is slowly fading.

Redemption through small acts of mercy.

Courage of the humble.

Nature as a living moral force.


### 5. Sound & Rhythm: The Music of Language

He wrote prose that feels like it could be sung.
Use alliteration, assonance, and internal rhyme subtly.

Far over the misty mountains cold,
To dungeons deep and caverns old…”

Tip: Read your prose aloud — it should flow like a river, not clatter like a typewriter.


### 6. Humanity Amid the Myth

Tolkien balanced grandeur with hobbit plainness. Amid gods and kings, he gave us tea kettles, pipe smoke, and good soil.
Let your story breathe with warmth and simple folk wisdom.

### 7. Practice Exercise

Try writing a short paragraph about a ruined watchtower in Tolkien’s voice.  Example:

The old tower stood upon the hill like a sentinel who had forgotten his watch. Ivy wound about its stones, and the wind
played in the hollow of its gate. Once, men had kept fire there, guarding the northern road; but the years had worn even
the memory of their names. Only the crows remained, black-winged heralds of silence.

### Summary
